# DEVOPS ON AWS

## Amazon API Gateway

is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale [1]. An API, or Application Programming Interface, acts as a middleman between applications and backend services. It essentially provides a way for applications to access data, functionality, or business logic from backend resources.

### Here are some of the key features of API Gateway:

1. Supports multiple API types: Create `RESTful APIs`, which are a popular architectural style for APIs, or `WebSocket APIs`, which enable real-time two-way communication between applications.
2. Acts as a front door: API Gateway centralizes access to your backend services, such as those running on EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or web applications.
3. Manages API traffic: API Gateway handles many of the heavy lifting tasks associated with APIs, including traffic management, security features like authorization and access control, throttling to prevent overload, monitoring, and API version management.
4. Cost-effective: There are no minimum fees or startup costs to use API Gateway. You are only charged for the API calls you receive and the data transferred.

If you're looking to build APIs for your own applications or open them up to third-party developers, AWS API Gateway is a powerful tool that can streamline the process.
