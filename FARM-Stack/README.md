It is based on document model i.e. collection of docs

# MongoDB is a NoSQL database

that uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary Serialized Object Notation). This allows for flexible and dynamic schema design, and makes it well-suited for handling large amounts of semi-structured or unstructured data.
In MongoDB, data is organized into collections, which are similar to tables in relational databases. Each collection contains a set of documents, which are similar to rows in a relational database. However, unlike relational databases, MongoDB documents can have different fields and structures, and can be modified dynamically without requiring a fixed schema.
Some key features of MongoDB's document model include:

1. Flexible schema: MongoDB's schema is dynamic and can be modified at runtime, allowing for easy adaptation to changing data structures and requirements.
2. Hierarchical data: MongoDB's document model allows for hierarchical data structures, where documents can contain embedded documents and arrays.
3. Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling, making it suitable for large and distributed datasets.
4. High performance: MongoDB's document model and indexing capabilities allow for fast query performance and data retrieval.
   Overall, MongoDB's document model and NoSQL design make it a popular choice for modern web and mobile applications, big data analytics, and real-time data processing.
